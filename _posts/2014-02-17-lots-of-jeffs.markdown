There are a lot of Jeff Martins around. I'll start with some famous ones. The
first Jeff Martin I came across is also probably my favorite. That is the [Jeff
Martin of The Simpsons fame][1]. He wrote a lot of good episodes, including one
of my favorites, [Homer's Barbershop Quartet][2].

<!-- more start -->
Another famous Jeff Martin, though probably less so, is the Jeff Martin of the
band [Idaho][3]. I used to like it more than I do now, though that's probably just
because of his name. There's another guy named Jeff Martin who played guitar in
[The Tea Party][4], but Idaho is a little more my style.

Now on to the less famous Jeff Martin's -- I know of two. I know them because
sometimes I receive their emails (I got on the Gmail train early). One of them
is an east coaster who is into the Tea Party. Another is a web developer like
me! He has a great site that lists [a much larger list of Jeff Martins][5] than
in this post. He seems like a nice guy.

Side note, we're all brown-haired white guys.
