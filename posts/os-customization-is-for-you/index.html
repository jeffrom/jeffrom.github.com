This time around, I moved back to linux from OSX.
Containerized workloads in particular for me have been annoying me on OSX for a while.
Linux is generally a better OS if you are spending a lot of your time writing and building
code that mostly runs on servers. OSX is generally fine about this, but everywhere I&rsquo;ve
worked, there&rsquo;s always one application that has a large enough codebase to cause
<a href=https://forums.docker.com/t/file-access-in-mounted-volumes-extremely-slow-cpu-bound/8076/2>filesystem slowness</a> to become frustrating. Most of my time on computers is
spent between a terminal and a browser, so I don&rsquo;t have particularly complex workflows.
Warning: This post likely wont be very interesting to you, unless you are interested in
computers and customizing your laptop, or maybe you dislike customization and want to
explore why by following along.</p><p>It&rsquo;s definitely true that compared to OSX, setting up linux takes a lot of time. It takes
2 hours to set up a macbook because the defaults are mostly the best. There are annoying
differences between darwin and linux, but it&rsquo;s easy enough to work around them, and
because the overall experience is good, it&rsquo;s just fundamentally out of your way to extent
you stop noticing over time. That&rsquo;s a huge benefit to OSX, and linux just doesn&rsquo;t have
that property. Buying a computer with linux preinstalled may help somewhat, but overall,
you&rsquo;ll likely need to expend some energy to find a suitable configuration.</p><p>If you use linux, you may as well just commit to do some tweaking. That can be as little
as bootstrapping configuration files and installing some preferred applications, through
to installing a modified kernel. In a few days you can create a more or less
bootstrap-capable, more or less optimal workflow for yourself, and while there is wisdom
in keeping tweaks minimal so muscle memory translates to different machines, your laptop
is still the primary means through which many of us are using computers.</p><p>So I decided to spend a few days doing tweaks, mostly porting the few common workflows I
have over from OSX, or replacing them with a reasonable alternative. I ended up spending
the most time playing with <a href=https://www.nerdfonts.com/>nerd fonts</a> and <a href=https://github.com/tmux/tmux>tmux</a>. I made my terminal
bar look something like my menu bar. Here is the menu bar:</p><p><img src=img/menubar.png alt="My menu bar"></p><p>Here is the terminal bar:</p><p><img src=img/tmuxbar.png alt="My tmux status"></p><p>They have some similarities, at least in how its components are placed. The terminal
status has a lot more going on than the desktop. It&rsquo;s easier for me to get to a menu bar I
like in the terminal, since it&rsquo;s just a line of characters, plus I spend a lot more time
there, so that is better for me. Nerd fonts are nice here, since real estate is at a
premium, and the icons are unobtrusive (read: not distracting). In particular, it&rsquo;s easy
to see, at a glance, what&rsquo;s happening in a tab. If a program is running, there&rsquo;s a little
Tux to the left of it. If it&rsquo;s running as root, there&rsquo;s a cube. If I&rsquo;m in a directory with
a git repository, there&rsquo;s an icon for that too. The clock and battery indicator are very
useful for me, since I usually work in a fullscreen terminal, and can lose track of the
time. It&rsquo;s easy to go from here to integrating a pomodoro timer, or any other tool. Last,
the CPU and memory indicators are cute, and I&rsquo;ve found they come in handy from time to
time.</p><p>To do this customization, I used a combination of plugins, other peoples hacks, and my
own hacks:</p><ul><li>a patched font</li><li>a fallback font for nerd fonts, supported by the terminal (kitty)</li><li>tmux plugins</li><li>shell configuration</li><li>forking a tmux theme (gruvbox!)</li><li>writing a <a href=https://github.com/jeffrom/tinygraph>small graphing tool</a></li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s a lot that needs to work together. I get that&rsquo;s not for everyone! There are easier
ways to get this all working than what I did. For example, there are plenty of fonts that
don&rsquo;t need to be patched in order to work nicely with kitty. Kitty by itself could
probably handle a lot of what tmux does too. There are surely plenty of already existing
tools to print unicode graphs. All of these things can also be done using other terminals
or window managers, in many cases likely with less configuration. All I can really say to
that is, I leveraged the tools I like to use so I can use them according to muscle and
visual memory. It&rsquo;s pretty tailored to me specifically, meaning it works according to my
principles for computer work and play.</p><p>If, for some reason, you don&rsquo;t write code, and you&rsquo;re still reading, here is where your
eyes will really glaze over. I&rsquo;m going to show some code I used to get some of the more
custom behavior out of this setup. In order to accomplish the title updates for directory
change or program execution, here&rsquo;s what I did in <code>~/.bashrc</code>. First, to handle updating
the title when commands are executed:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic># runs before command runs</span>
