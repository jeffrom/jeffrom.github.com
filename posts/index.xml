This time around, I moved back to linux from OSX. Containerized workloads in particular for me have been annoying on OSX for a while. Linux is a nicer OS if you are spending a lot of your time writing and building code. Everywhere I&amp;rsquo;ve worked, there&amp;rsquo;s always one application that has a large enough codebase to cause filesystem slowness to become frustrating. Most of my time on computers is spent between a terminal and a browser, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have a particularly complex workflow.</description></item></channel></rss>
