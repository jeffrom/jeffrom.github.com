This time around, I moved back to linux from OSX. Containerized workloads in particular for me have been annoying on OSX for a while. Linux is a nicer OS if you are spending a lot of your time writing and building code. Everywhere I&amp;rsquo;ve worked, there&amp;rsquo;s always one application that has a large enough codebase to cause filesystem slowness to become frustrating. Most of my time on computers is spent between a terminal and a browser, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have a particularly complex workflow.</description></item><item><title>about</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>about me computers, the internet, music, history, learning more.
I&amp;rsquo;m the author of logd, a log server with emphasis on simplicity and speed.
I did a talk at The Big Elixir in 2018 on testing a large api server.
I have some other projects on github.</description></item></channel></rss>
