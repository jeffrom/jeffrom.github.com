title: Hello

This is my first blog in a while. I believe my last one was on LiveJournal.
This blog will be a place for me to post close-ups of food, play with frontend
code, and cat pictures. Always those. Sorry for the rough edges.

At the time of this writing I am a developer at MyLikes, a startup in San
Francisco, where I spend a lot of time writing web applications. This blog is
pretty minimal for a blog, and it will likely stay that way.

Here is a poem that I like. Computers are a theme. The olden computer times,
when filesystems were really just different web browsers... Yet he still
manages to make it about sex kind of. Poetry!

16-bit Intel 8088 chip
----------------------

    with an Apple Macintosh
    you can't run Radio Shack programs
    in its disc drive.
    nor can a Commodore 64
    drive read a file
    you have created on an
    IBM Personal Computer.
    both Kaypro and Osborne computers use
    the CP/M operating system
    but can't read each other's
    handwriting
    for they format (write
    on) discs in different
    ways.
    the Tandy 2000 runs MS-DOS but
    can't use most programs produced for
    the IBM Personal Computer
    unless certain
    bits and bytes are
    altered
    but the wind still blows over
    Savannah
    and in the Spring
    the turkey buzzard struts and
    flounces before his
    hens.

Charles Bukowski
