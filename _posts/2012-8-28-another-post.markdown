> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
> It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
> making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
> professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
> the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
> passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical

> Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
> BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
> during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
